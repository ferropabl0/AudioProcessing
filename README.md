# AudioProcessing
 
This repository contains some Jupyter notebooks by Pablo Fern√°ndez, with the aim of gathering the Audio Signal Processing knowledge acquired during the Audiovisual Systems Engineering degree, especially for applying to the Dolby Intern position.

The tools used in it are from the sms-tools project (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Music Technology Group).

To check it, run dolby_processing.ipynb.
